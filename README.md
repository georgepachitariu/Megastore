Megastore
=========

This was a part of my Master degree project. The thesis which accompanies this can be found [here](http://dare.uva.nl/cgi/arno/show.cgi?fid=557481).

This is an implementation in Java of the data replication scheme from the distributed database Megastore by Google [white paper](http://cidrdb.org/cidr2011/Papers/CIDR11_Paper32.pdf) which uses the Paxos algorithm. 

After this I designed several optimizations to it which involved using multithreading in a distributed system. I used automatic testing and kept logs for finding errors.
